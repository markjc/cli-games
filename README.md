Classic Games Platform, run in the Command Line

This project is part of an initial learning experience as I grow as a developer. As many intial projects are ports of classic or simple 1-2 player games, i.e. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, etc, this project will serve as a base system to launch these games, and allow me to program additional games as I learn more and more about the language, and programming in general. 

To run the game system, clone the project, and run main.py via Python 3 in the terminal. 

The Main Launcher will contain a menu that lists all the available games, as well as an exit option. Follow the on-screen instructions and enjoy. 

As always, any feedback is not only appreciated but encouraged as I continue to learn the basics, as well as being more pythonic in general.
